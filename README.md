Problem statement:
In South Africa there are currently no ways for the general public to make digital payments without using a linked bank account. The general population is limited as to how they can make payments using banks or neo banks which are regulated by the banks. 

Proposed solution:
Blackbook wallet is the solution. It is a decentralized system that uses blockchain to give customers the control they want over their finances. Blackbook wallet is a digital wallet that allows users to own their system while they use the code. Blackbook keeps users safe by using highly secure cryptography and having no centralized database that can be hacked. 

Pricing: 
The pricing of blackbook wallet will be made so transactions on the system between users are free below a specified amount. These can be used for day to day purchases and transactions. Alternative wallets charge users a fee for each transaction that is done. Blackbook wallet will provide a quota of free transactions to users every month. To speed up transactions or to make large payments users will be required to use premium services. The fees for the premium services will be a small percentage of the transaction 0.2%
